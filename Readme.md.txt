NARA

Controls: 
Use A and D to move left and right, use S to ground slam, and use space to jump and double jump.

Level structure: 
The idea is for the player to start off with just simple movements such as left and right and a single jump.
As the player explores the world they unlock more movement abilities which allows the player to explore more areas,
and unlock more abilities.

The most challenging/ interesting parts of the prototype:

Most challenging part would have to be making the world feel smooth and natural but without having the player being
able to get outside of the level/ intended play area. People always find a way to do things you don't expect them to so
putting limits on the players mobility i.e. cooldown on dash, or limit to single or double jump help with that.

Most interesting part would probably be how some features in the game are not intended but end up working really well
so they stayed in, such as the wall climbing mechanic where the player can reset the jump/ double jump mechanic by 
touching the walls. Or how a wall of breakable blocks can all shatter from just one being broken and causing a chain reaction.
